1. In PHP classes and functions must have a unique name to function without pbs.
Larger project use third party libraries, which may contain conflicting names.
Till now all our code existed in the Global namespace. Namespace = package.

If we try to include two User classes in our code, we will get an error.
We should give the classes namespaces so that there is no conflict.
For example for the Library/User.php class we give it a namespace. Words are separated by \.
namespace Library\Auth\classes;

We have to include the file in our code: require 'Library/User.php';
To use the Library/User.php class we have to prefix the class with the namespace:
$john = new Library\Auth\classes\User();
